# homebrew-setupswiftproject

First attempt at creating a homebrew formulae (since I wrote a script to automate the process already). After reading some docs, [homebrew does not like binary formulas](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae#we-dont-like-binary-formulae). Will reconfig this repo for homebrew.

## for now

feel free to clone the repo + run the binary in an swift project to expedite the process:

### this binary (bash script) creates:
- `.gitignore` (swift github default)
- `.swiftlint.yml` (random starter template -- will change)
- MIT `LICENCE`
- `README.md`
